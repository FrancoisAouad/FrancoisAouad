### Hello there, I'm Frank 👋

I'm currently working on building microservices using Node.js frameworks. I'm also interested in Spring boot, and Go. I'm a big linux, and Red Hat fan. Hoping to learn more about Kubertes and IaC tools.

💬 Feel free to ask me anything about: Software Architecture, System Design, Microservices, Design Patterns, Operating Systems, Node.js, C++, Java, Databases, DevOps, Sports, Philosophy, History, Literature. I'm eager to learn from others too! As Aristotle wisely stated, "It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it." Let's engage in thoughtful discussions and broaden our horizons together!

🌱 I’m currently on a mission to learn German! Learning the language has always been a goal of mine, and I'm currently leveling up my skills and knowledge to become a Deutsch mastermind 🇩🇪! Ich werde mein Bestes geben!

☁️ I'd love to share a quote that a friend once shared with me during our university days. It has been a constant source of inspiration for me, and I hope it resonates with my fellow programmers reading this as well:

Programming is not just a craft; it's an art form. Languages and frameworks serve as the brushes and palette for a skilled artist to create their masterpiece.
